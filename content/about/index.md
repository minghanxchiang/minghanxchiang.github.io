## About Me
Hi, I am **_Minghan Chiang_**, though I usually go by **_Daniel Chiang_**. I hold an MA in Economics from the University of Rochester in New York, and I am currently working as a data analyst at a tech start-up in Taipei.

Before transitioning out of academia, I conducted quantitative economic research using experimental methods and statistical causal models for over five years.

My greatest passion in my career is applying the right statistical models to the right datasets to answer real-world questions and gain valuable insights.

I also love learning new models, adapting new methodologies, and exploring analytical strategies in my daily work.

This blog serves as a place where I store my study notes, showcase my previous projects, and, most importantly, share my experience of using applied economics research methods to solve business problems.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-minghan-chiang-b27637117) or [Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/1XILN) if youâ€™re a movie fan like me. As a budding gourmand, I also have a [Medium Page](https://medium.com/@daniel84101) (in Chinese) where I share some of my culinary adventures at great restaurants and bars. If you have any ideas to share, [writing me an email](mailto:minghanxchiang@gmail.com) would be a great way to start.
